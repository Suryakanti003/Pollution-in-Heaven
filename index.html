  <meta property="og:description" content="Yakhis (God of trees) have sent you to earth to reduce pollution there. But while going down you were shocked how much the pollution has risen and have became so deadly you were so shocked that you fell from the cloud that you were standing on. You somehow manage to escape but your magical stick was broken a little bit and you can’t\n fly for long and you need to recharge it by standing on a platform,\n the saplings that you brought with you are above on the cloud and they are falling from it.\n Now it’s upto you to plant many trees to reduce the pollution and not let it go to heaven.">
